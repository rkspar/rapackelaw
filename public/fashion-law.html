The Rapacke Law Group Fashion attorneys handle numerous matters which includes areas like: intellectual property, business law, licensing, contracts, textiles, merchandising and import/export. 

							</p>
							<p><strong>Fashion & Intellectual Property Law</strong></p><p>For fashion clients, the most important company asset is their trademark/brand. As a result, most fashion lawyers will tell you the bulk of their work involves intellectual property, copyright and trademarks, [IP]. An example of the kind of IP case a fashion lawyer would handle is best illustrated in the case of Louis Vuitton vs. Nadia Plesner. Danish artist Nadia Plesner, sick of the continued coverage of the superficial and silly lives of celebrities, decided to make a mockery of the media and direct attention to issues that matter such as the genocide in Darfur. Plesner depicted the stereoptypical naked starving African kid with a rotunda stomach and flat butt on a T-shirt. The child symbolizing Paris Hilton, was accessorized with only a Paris Hilton pink little dog and a Louis Vuitton [LV] bag. LV got notice of Plesner’s work and in response sent its cease and desist letter. Plesner responded with the right as an artist to express herself. LV filed suit.</p>
							<p><strong>Fashion Trademark Licensing Agreements</strong></p>
							<p>It is very common to see the practice of licensing of products under popular designer names or trademarks. Think lifestyle brands like Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors and more. Fashion law attorneys must know how to identify, prevent and protect their clients with licensing agreements that take into consideration licensor and licensee issues like distribution channels, licensor’s control over design, royalties, copyright protection and arbitration.</p>
							<p><strong>Fashion & Employment/Labor law</strong></p><p>If you run your legal business and hire employees, you must be concerned about compliance with employment/labor law. The fashion industry is no exception to the rule. Within California, for example, there are over 300,000 employees in the apparel and textile industries. Most of them are located in Los Angeles and it is the business of fashion lawyers to know how to help their fashion clients comply with employment and labor laws. An example of how employment/ labor law violations would come into play remains the case of the notorious American Apparel company [AA], which is the largest T-shirt manufacturer in the U.S.A. AA has been sued too many times to count for all sort of labor and employment law violations. In one instance of a sexual harassment suit filed against the Los Angeles based AA, which was ultimately dismissed by a federal judge in 2005, a former employee who worked for AA for two and a half months alleged she was exposed to a hostile work environment; partly because of a collage of vintage penthouse magazine covers used to decorate the store.</p><p><strong>Fashion & Criminal Law</strong></p><p>Imitation they say is the highest form of flattery. This indeed has always been the case in the fashion world until recently. These days, it is becoming very expensive to copy other people’s work. For the most part, knock-off kings seemed to suffer only monetary losses. Lately, counterfeiting laws under the trademark statutes which have criminal provisions are now being enforced both on a state and federal level. For example, in late 2007, the Los Angeles Police Department [LAPD] and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department conducted the largest raid ever in downtown LA’s shopping district. Linking counterfeit goods to gang activity, they confiscated over $8 million counterfeit goods and arrested 26 people.</p><p><strong>Fashion & International Law</strong></p><p>With today’s globalization, most Americans if not all are wearing apparel made in China and India.</p><p>For fashion attorneys with clients doing business overseas, this means an understanding of international trademark protection, contract, trade and custom laws.</p>

										<blockquote>
											<p>"Andrew is a great intellectual property attorney. He's very transparent on price and was very thorough with the provisional patent. He made all the changes I asked for before we filed the patent and he runs a truly fixed fee intellectual property law firm. Other lawyers want to nickel and dime you for every change you make, which can be extremely difficult to pay for inventors just starting out or on a budget. He was easily accessible as well. If he missed my call, I would get a call back within an hour or two. It was a great experience overall and if you are looking for an intellectual property attorney I would highly reccomend you look no further than The Rapacke Law Group."</p>

											<p>"Andrew introduced himself to me at a Toy Fair in Chicago. We talked briefly about some projects that I was working on the time, but I already had representation. Andrew offered to give me some advise on a pending patent. I was impressed with his knowledge of the patent process. I hired him to help me with an office action on that same patent. I also hired Andrew to help me put together a Licensing Agreement. I feel that Andrew does a very good job of looking at the agreement from both sides of the fence. He has good judgment and wants to guide you, so that your expectations are realistic."</p>

											<p>The Rapacke Law Group’s engineering background makes us well equipped to understand the science behind the medical devices and products which we represent, and this allows us to help bring products to marketplace. Our firm works with clients to develop and protect new IP, establish financing and financial partnerships, create a strategic plan for development and production, and build distribution and licensing channels. With a comprehensive approach, RLG helps protect products and designs through prosecution and filing for IP protections and ensuring compliance with regulatory and legal frameworks in both the domestic and international settings.</p>
											<h4>Product Liability or Medical Malpractice?</h4>
											<p>As in other products liability cases, plaintiffs in medical product cases sometimes raise the issue of the manufacturer's or other provider's failure to warn about the potential dangers of their products. Many times, manufacturers of these types of products can fulfill their duty by providing the warnings to the physicians, nurses, or other medical personnel who will be using the products, and then the duty passes to those professionals to inform the patient. There is a fine line between a products liability action involving a defective medical device and a medical malpractice action, and a lawyer experienced in this area can help both plaintiffs and defendants determine which law applies.</p>

											<p>Fashion law is a specialized area of law that deals with intellectual property (copyright and trademark law, including brand licensing), domestic and international business transactions, textiles, merchandising, employment and labor concerns, and customs (import/export issues).</p>
											<p>Traditionally, most fashion lawyers work for established fashion and luxury goods companies in major urban commercial centers such as New York City, Paris, London and Milan. Some fashion lawyers work within the company, and others work outside the company for law firms. Fashion Law is a quickly growing legal specialty, and several American law and design schools have dedicated clinics and courses to its study. In a 2008 article, Susan Scafidi, the first U.S. law professor ever to offer a course in Fashion Law and later Director of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham Law, wrote that Fashion Law was only then starting to be recognized as a distinct field. Since then, Deborah McNamara at Parsons The New School for Design, and Guillermo Jimenez at the Fashion Institute of Technology at the State University of New York, have also offered courses in Fashion Law. However, such courses remain rare.</p><p>The Rapacke Law Group is one of the few Florida firms that has a practice group dedicated to Fashion Law.</p><p>Fashion houses and accessory designers both face unique challenges specific to their industry. They require attorneys who understand the nature of short seasons and ever-changing product cycles, pressures surrounding counterfeit goods, and the issues of unfair competition. Valuable assets in the fashion business consist of not only intellectual property rights, but also trade arrangements, contracts, and information technology systems. A fashion attorney’s career success may depend on being able to effectively protect these assets by delivering industry-specific legal advice tailored to the clients’ needs</p><p>Our fashion attorneys participate in a variety of legal activities and negotiate deals for their clients. The clients may be large retail chains, haute couture labels, high-fashion models, or an unknown designers just starting out. If and when the situation arises, The Rapacke Law Group will litigate for his or her clients in court.</p>

											<h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Copyright</h4>
										</div>
										<div class="modal-body">
											<p><p>A Copyright is part of American intellectual property law that protects “original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression.” It is the exclusive legal right, given to an originator or an assignee to print, publish, perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material, and to authorize others to do the same. In other words, copyright does not protect mere ideas or facts, it protects the way ideas, facts and other things are expressed, though only once they are in a tangible form.</p><p>A Copyright can cover both published and unpublished works. The thing protected only has to be tangible or expressed; whether it is published or not does not matter. However, only original works can be protected by copyright. Often you will see written work such as articles like this protected by copyright, but it isn’t just written work that gets protected. Copyrights protect any sort of original authorship including artistic, dramatic, literary and musical works. Examples of these things include architecture, books, computer software, movies, plays, poems, and songs.</p><p>Copyright is grounded in the U.S. Constitution and granted by law. That means that the law and specific cases have found that the Constitution is the source of copyright, and have gone on to clarify and grant the protection.</p><p>Why bother with copyrights?</p><p>Well, the holder of copyright is the only person with the right to do and/or authorize others to do several things. The copyright lets you display the original work in public, or, where applicable, perform it in public including using digital audio to do so.</p><p>Copyright also allows you to make copies of the original, whether they are recordings (such as sound recordings of songs or audiovisual recordings of movies) or printed copies (such as books, poems or articles) as well as distribute any copies you make, including for profit.</p><p>Finally, if you hold a copyright to an original work you are allowed to make “derivative works” based on your original. This means you can create a newer version or a new work that includes substantial elements of the original work without penalty.</p>
							<p>Can you use a song you like underneath a photo montage on your website without infringing on copyright?</p><p>Technically, no, not without permission.</p><p>Can you ever use songs or movie clips or photos without permission?</p><p>No, unless they are in the public domain, or you are using them for parody, which is usually considered “fair use” under the law. Parody is valued in the United States under free speech and expression laws, so courts really try to accommodate it.</p><p>What about something like Flickr or Google Images – Can you post something you find on there without infringing?</p><p>Probably not. Unless something is explicitly in the public domain or commons, or you have gotten permission, chances are that you are infringing by posting that image. It’s so easy to do that it’s also easy to forget, but that’s the reality of copyright.</p><p>In the age of blogging, you may wonder if you can use material from a blog without permission. Typically you may quote a few lines of someone else’s work just as someone else may quote a few lines from yours. There are no set guidelines about how much you have to quote in order to commit copyright infringement, so be careful. Always reference where you got the quotes and make sure it’s obvious that it is a quote in the first place. Always link back to the original.</p><p>You don’t have to officially register a work with the government for it to enjoy copyright protection, but you should. The moment you express the work and it becomes tangible, it is protected by copyright. However, if ever you need to file a lawsuit to assert your rights against someone who is infringing upon your copyrighted work, you’ll need to register.</p><p>Furthermore, registering your work even before you need to can help you win a case later, and also can help you get your legal fees paid for by your infringing opponent. You may have heard of mailing yourself a copy of your own work: the “poor man’s copyright.” Make no mistake! This is not an actual part of copyright law and does not take the place of registration.</p><p>You have probably also heard of a patent and a trademark, here is how copyrights are different: 
</p><p>Copyrights protect original pieces of authorship, not discoveries, ideas or inventions. Discoveries, ideas and inventions are exactly what patents protect. In this way the two types of intellectual property protections fit together like puzzle pieces.
</p><p>Trademarks are the third piece of the puzzle. A trademark protects a design, phrase, slogan, symbol or word that identifies a brand or business and sets it apart from all others. A drawing is protected by copyright unless it is used repeatedly to distinguish one brand or business from another. In the latter case it is protected by trademark.
</p><p>Sometimes one single ad will require both copyright and trademark protection. An ad campaign for a new kind of soap might produce a unique slogan just for that soap and its ad. A Copyright protects the text and graphics of the ad but not the slogan. A Trademark protects the slogan but not the rest of the ads. Both kinds of registration are needed to fully protect these ads from infringement.
</p><p>The United States has intellectual property agreements with most other countries, which means that a copyright granted in the U.S. will be given full force in most other countries. For questions about copyrights – obtaining or protecting one, you can connect with one of our helpful copyright lawyers for a free initial consultation!
